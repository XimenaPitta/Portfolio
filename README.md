# Portfolio

Hi, I am Ximena!

This repository is designated to share the programming projects I've done to help me polish my analytics skills. 

I have experience in Python, R (RStudio), C++ (CLion), SQL (MySQL) and M (Matlab). 

I am currently interested and working on Business and Consumer Analytics.
